E_AR stands for Educative Augmented Reality. Its an AR application intends to help understand various educational concept with interactions. We designed an mobile application where a student can gain more access to selected textbook concepts. In this project two such scenarios are implemented which are a relative position of 
earth moon and sun in the solar system and a basic chemical reaction. 

The application is designed using simple and intuitive interface.
